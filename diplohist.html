    Introduction and Context: The Seven Years War
  </h2>

  <div class="intro">
    <p>
      The Seven Years’ War was a vicious transatlantic conflict fought primarily between the two greatest military superpowers the world had ever seen, Britain and France. 
      The consequences of this war for both the Continent and the Americas soon resulted in the American Revolution, and later the French Revolution. 
      By analyzing historical discussion regarding the outcome of the Seven Years War, the origins and effects of the American Revolution, and the origins of the French Revolution, it is possible to gain a clearer idea of the interconnectedness of these events, as well as their key differences. 
      The crucial event leading to these revolutions was the Seven Years’ War, though it was only the match that lit the fire – soon, the issues it resulted in: leadership, ideological, and fiscal, became powerful forces which forced the hands of the citizenry and made the revolutions inevitable. 
      The American Revolution was a result not only of the Seven Years’ War, but also of diplomatic and fiscal issues within Britain, between England and the colonies. 
      Inversely, the French Revolution stemmed much more from internal issues than international ones, though international policy did play a significant role.

        Fought between 1756 and 1763, the Seven Years’ War was “a struggle for global primacy between Britain and France,” one in which “the fate of North America would be decided.” (Elliott, Page 292)       Beginning on the American continent between expansionist British leadership and the French, it quickly came to a full overseas war. (Elliott, Page 294) 
        Through naval superiority, alliances with the natives, and strategic leadership, the British crushed the French colony and by 1760 “the conquest of Canada was complete.” (Elliott, Page 294)
        Elliot here remarks on the “triumphant peoples,” of King George III “on both sides of the Atlantic,” which is true, and something that would later come to play in causing the American Revolution. (Elliot, Page 294) 
        By the stunning victory of the British over the French, and later the Spanish who came to their aid, the British conclusively demonstrated their excellence at waging war. 
        T.H. Breen argues that over the century and especially as a result of their victory, “Britain became the supreme example in the western world of a State organized for effective war.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The immediate effects of the war were multiple; the French were all but removed from transatlantic influence, having lost all of their territory on the North American mainland and retained only the island colonies of Guadeloupe and Martinique, for their valuable sugar plantations. 
        Defeat also meant an economic downturn, as the war, which while manageable if handled correctly, was funded by borrowing rather than direct taxation. 
        Britain basked in the glow of victory, on both sides of the Atlantic, but began to focus on reform for its American colony. 
        Prior to 1763, the British were rather disinterested in the affairs of the colonies, but as the war brought attention to its American colonies, it also brought attention to the deficits in management which became apparent to the European side of the British Empire and in need of repair. 
        Primarily, this resulted in increased scrutiny on the American colonies at a time when sentiment and British nationalism was at an all time high, as the colonists had been, as far as they were concerned, instrumental in winning the war.

      The American Revolution: Causes and Correlations
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Seven Years War was particularly impactful for the British, where it resulted in both a weakening of the bonds between the imperial and metropolitan governments in the American colonies, as well as straining their relations over a concern for the national debt. (Scott, Page 441) 
      The victory in the Americas as well as the rising colony in the Far East led Britain to have “new attitudes towards its overseas territories.” (Scott, 442) 
      These attitudes, combined with those discussed earlier regarding the effort of London to extend control over its American colonies financially, only intensified as time progressed. 
      This lead to a stark contrast of ideas between the colonists, who paid to erect statues of George III and William Pitt; and the British, who began to see the colonists more as subjects in need of control and less as countrymen who travelled across the ocean. (Scott, Page 442-443)    
    </p>
    <p>
      Greene argues that “perhaps the single most important result of the war in terms of the metropolitan-colonial relationship was the vivid enhancement of awareness on both sides of the Atlantic of the crucial significance of the colonies to Britain both economically and strategically.” (Greene, 85) 
      Until at least the mid 1760s, ordinary Americans had no interest in a new national identity through revolution. (Breen, 30) 
      The Americans did not invent the ideas of difference and inferiority, but rather the British who, to the colonists, exported it through unjust taxes and laws. 
      These intolerable acts sent a clear message of persecution, rooted in the high value each group placed on America, but with different expectations as a result. 
      Connecticut Governor Thomas Fitch in 1764 revealed through words a startling colonial awareness of this, the dichotomy between the views each government shared of the colonists: “The people in the colonies and plantations in America are really, truly, and in every respect as much the King’s subjects as those born and living in Great Britain are.” (Breen, Page 30) 
      These arguments present a convincing image in which the Americans saw from the British an expectation for a future they wanted no part of.    
    </p>
    <p>
      This desire of the British to raise the taxes of the lightly taxed and prosperous American colonies in order to combat the national debt ran counter to the colonists’ desire to be rewarded and praised for their part in the victory of the war and treated as equals. 
      Most colonists certainly viewed themselves as equal to or more virtuous than their compatriots back in London and were also more accustomed to exercising their rights to vote, as property was inexpensive and plentiful in the colonies. (Page, Page 21-22) 
      As such, Britain’s imposition of additional taxes without an American vote such as the Stamp Act and the duty on tea were not seen by Americans as simply the Empire in need of funds, but rather as a plot to set standards for postwar colonial policy, standards which the Americans did not believe were just. 
      Emphasizing this aspect of postwar colonial culture, Page claims that the operative cause of the American revolution was an ideological one, in which the precedent and principle of the tax acts, more than their actual fiscal toll, exacerbated by differing views on the role the colonists played in the Empire, was what invoked the Sons of Liberty to initiate the Boston Tea Party and the revolutionaries to revolt. (Page, Page 24) 
    </p>
    <p>
      Another potential cause for the American Revolution is the removal of French forces from the American continent. 
      Their defeat, through the Seven Years’ War, led to their complete expulsion from the continent, with somewhat disastrous effects, in hindsight, for the victors. 
      Throughout the eighteenth century, British and French forces were at odds within the continent, leading to a clear enemy for British colonists to focus on: it was the British versus the French. 
      With the French removed, the differences perceived by the colonists and the Empire turned inwards, and lead to a fractured relationship. Greene argues that the effect of this situation was most important to those in power in the metropolis. (Greene, Page 94) 
      This is because it “not only made the colonies less dependant upon Britain for protection; it also left Britain with a much freer hand to proceed with its programme of colonial reform.” (Greene, Page 94) 
    </p>
    <p>
      The scholarship agrees that the Seven Years War led to the American Revolution, but for different and nuanced reasons which, when all considered together provide a well-rounded account for the rise of the revolution. 
      War caused an increase in colonial taxes, which to the colonists were hostile and illegal, and the beginning of undeclared economic war. 
      The Intolerable Acts continued the unspoken conflict between London and America, until silence could be held no longer, and the emergence of the Declaration of Independence clearly exposed the importance Americans held on the consent of the governed and their perspective on its being withheld from Americans on decisions affecting America. 
      A clear beginning of the revolution was the Seven Years War, and its effects manifested in varying manners, mainly ideological and political, to the outcome of the revolution. 
      In the end, it was also the warmongering diplomacy of the era that did what it did best and started a war between the greatest military power in the world and one of its colonies.

      American to French Revolution: Continuing the Tale
    </h2>
    <p id="summaryatf">
      The American Revolution had consequences which can be traced to the beginning of the French Revolution, in increasing French debt, propagating new ideologies, and setting a precedent for successful revolt against an oppressive ancien régime.
    </p>
    <div class="threeparagraphs">
      <p>
        After the defeat of the Seven Years’ War, the French desired to strike a blow to the power which Britain held, and so supported financially the American Revolution. 
        This was done without any of the necessary fiscal reforms which the Seven Years’ War brought to light and was achieved by further borrowing. 
        The already crushing French debt [LINK TO EARLIER REF] was drastically increased, and with no infrastructure in place to facilitate recovery from it, the inherent flaw in French leadership was obvious. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The American Revolution also gave rise to novel ideas regarding freedom and equality, as well as the consent of the governed. 
        In philosophical circles, the tornado of new thought regarding the rights of men owed them by their government became a potent force to change the thinking of the powerful but undervalued majority of the population, the Third Estate. 
        Contemporary observers, even, remarked on the prevalence of philosophical discussion in pre-revolution France as a cause of the revolution as early as 1795. “The works of Montesquieu, Rousseau, Raynal, were universally admired.” (Moore, Page 23) 
        Not only this, but the direct and unabashed participation in supporting these principles of freedom, by the French cabinet (even if done only as a result of striking a blow to the British) cast a strong light on the difference between the free land, governed by the people which the Americans fought for and their own despot.
      </p>
      <p>
        The success of the American revolution was also an important result in leading to the French Revolution. 
        Seeing a major shift in diplomatic power which made America independent also set a precedent for successful revolt against tyranny. 
        This perhaps did not cause the revolution in France but opened up the possibility as something that was conceivable, which likely it would not have been should the American revolution have failed.

    <h2>
      The French Revolution: Causes and Correlations
    </h2>
    <p>
      The French Revolution is likely the best example of a revolution in which almost every factor of the nation’s present and past circumstances worked together to create the need for a shift in the current power dynamics. 
      Since defeat at the Seven Years’ War, French debt was overwhelming, and the additional strain from funding the American revolution left it in shambles. 
      The ideological landscape was also ripe for an attempt to change society; the works of republican authors were prolific and taken at high value, not just for the French philosophes in their parlours, but also for those in the Third Estate with resources but no effective political power. 
      Additionally, the weak and often foolish leadership of Louis XVI at a time when a heavy hand was needed for stability left political actors with an ideologically packaged alternative to their monarch. 
      The diplomatic situation surrounding France, however, did not force the revolution to occur – Rothenberg discusses how there was rivalry in the international community, but that French and foreign diplomatic policy preferred peace over war. (Rothenberg, Page 777) 
      Not only that, but the internal strife was seen to the international community to be a diversion which would only continue the peace as the nation would be too crippled to go to war. (Rothenberg, 777)

      <h3>
        Understanding the Revolution Through A Contemporary: John Moore
      </h3>
      <p>
        John Moore, M.D. had two volumes published in 1795, titled <em>A View of the Causes and Progress of the French Revolution</em>, totalling nearly 500 pages of analysis of the state of affairs in France and its progress. 
        Moore was an Englishman, and his bias towards his own king and country are evident throughout the work, however he recognizes this, making note immediately in the preface to the duke of Devonshire that his earlier works had been criticized for bias and that “it is very difficult to write on the subject of the French Revolution without being accused of partiality.” (Moore, Page iii) 
        He goes on to say that the avoidance of bias is the disposition which he wrote his earlier, unnamed journal, and that the “present work has been executed in the same disposition,” allowing historians to know that while the bias was not expunged, it was at least avoided. (Moore, Page iv) 
        Through this work, Moore touches on every aspect which may have played a part in causing the revolution which he can imagine, whether significant or not. 
        Discussing the role of France in the American revolution, certainly a significant factor, all the way to the choice for the location for the Estates General being the Palace at Versailles. (Moore, Pages 37, 45) 
        Above all, this primary source demonstrates that the context with which modern historians view the causes of the French Revolution were also observed in their own time, by spectators to the violence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moore begins first by discussing the “spirit of philosophical discussion [which] prevailed very much in France,” and which he credits with being a major cause of the present revolution. (Moore, Page 22) 
        He analyzes the “many old prejudices, hurtful to society,” regarding the self-interest of the few and the ignoring of the many. (Moore, Page 23) 
        He convincingly argues that progression in industry and knowledge of the oppressed people of a nation, combined with the weakness of those with the most power, will surely lead to a revolution anywhere it is found. (Moore, Page 26) 
        This progression in industry and knowledge he ties directly to the dissatisfaction of the people with their present system, with rulers “distinguished for their follies and debasing amusements… [and while are] childishly fond of the trappings of a soldier and the pomp of war, shrink from its real dangers.” (Moore, Page 28) 
        Seeing their system and having the newfound ideologies in the forefront of their minds which would solve all of these issues, revolt was, ideologically, the method of choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next major cause the contemporary writer identifies is the role of France in supporting American independence. (Moore, Page 37) 
        In America, he argues, “many French officers caught republican sentiments and principles, which at their return spread with the rapidity of a new fashion over France.” (Moore, Pages 37-38) 
        Recognizing not only its ideological effect, Moore also comments on the financial toll of the endeavour. 
        “The Cabinet of Versailles expected, no doubt, that, without weakening France, the assistance given to America would greatly impoverish England. The effect has turned out otherwise; that measure, without much affecting the riches of England, has made France poor indeed.” (Moore, Page 38) 
        Additionally, Moore identifies more “remote causes,” of the revolution along with the major themes, such as the abolition of the King’s household troops, the “introduction of the German custom to punishing soldiers by blows,” and the choice of Versailles for the meeting of the Estates General. (Moore, Pages 38, 41, 45) 
        All of these factors, however, play into the principles of the growing knowledge the French people had of their situation, and the poor choices of the government leading to a perceived weakness of the monarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, Moore makes excellent arguments as to the causes of the French Revolution which have withstood the test of time. 
        The emphasis on the ideological and financial situations leading to the revolution is argued with similar reasoning as Scott, Rothenberg, and Censer employ in their theses. TODO LINK THEM HERE 
        While certain bias can be seen in the introductory pages, when arguments are made there is very little subjectivity, and it is clear that the focus is on the events that took place and what they led to, and not Moore’s opinion on them. 
        As a source, this work contains valuable information for historians to understand what a contemporary saw as the revolution's most important causes, certainly a source with a valuable perspective.
