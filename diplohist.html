    Introduction and Context: The Seven Years War
  </h2>

  <div class="intro">
    <p>
      The Seven Years’ War was a vicious transatlantic conflict fought primarily between the two greatest military superpowers the world had ever seen, Britain and France. 
      The consequences of this war for both the Continent and the Americas soon resulted in the American Revolution, and later the French Revolution. 
      By analyzing historical discussion regarding the outcome of the Seven Years War, the origins and effects of the American Revolution, and the origins of the French Revolution, it is possible to gain a clearer idea of the interconnectedness of these events, as well as their key differences. 
      The crucial event leading to these revolutions was the Seven Years’ War, though it was only the match that lit the fire – soon, the issues it resulted in: leadership, ideological, and fiscal, became powerful forces which forced the hands of the citizenry and made the revolutions inevitable. 
      The American Revolution was a result not only of the Seven Years’ War, but also of diplomatic and fiscal issues within Britain, between England and the colonies. 
      Inversely, the French Revolution stemmed much more from internal issues than international ones, though international policy did play a significant role.

      Fought between 1756 and 1763, the Seven Years’ War was “a struggle for global primacy between Britain and France,” one in which “the fate of North America would be decided.” (Elliott, Page 292)       Beginning on the American continent between expansionist British leadership and the French, it quickly came to a full overseas war. (Elliott, Page 294) 
      Through naval superiority, alliances with the natives, and strategic leadership, the British crushed the French colony and by 1760 “the conquest of Canada was complete.” (Elliott, Page 294)
      Elliot here remarks on the “triumphant peoples,” of King George III “on both sides of the Atlantic,” which is true, and something that would later come to play in causing the American Revolution. (Elliot, Page 294) 
      By the stunning victory of the British over the French, and later the Spanish who came to their aid, the British conclusively demonstrated their excellence at waging war. 
      T.H. Breen argues that over the century and especially as a result of their victory, “Britain became the supreme example in the western world of a State organized for effective war.”

      The immediate effects of the war were multiple; the French were all but removed from transatlantic influence, having lost all of their territory on the North American mainland and retained only the island colonies of Guadeloupe and Martinique, for their valuable sugar plantations. 
      Defeat also meant an economic downturn, as the war, which while manageable if handled correctly, was funded by borrowing rather than direct taxation. 
      Britain basked in the glow of victory, on both sides of the Atlantic, but began to focus on reform for its American colony. 
      Prior to 1763, the British were rather disinterested in the affairs of the colonies, but as the war brought attention to its American colonies, it also brought attention to the deficits in management which became apparent to the European side of the British Empire and in need of repair. 
      Primarily, this resulted in increased scrutiny on the American colonies at a time when sentiment and British nationalism was at an all time high, as the colonists had been, as far as they were concerned, instrumental in winning the war.
